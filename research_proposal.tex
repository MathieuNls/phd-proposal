\begin{abstract}

  The maintenance and evolution of complex software systems account for more than 70\% software's life cycle.
  More than two decades of research has been conducted to improve our knowledge of these processes in terms of issue triaging, issue prediction, duplicate issue detection, issue reproduction and changes prediction.
  This research gave meaning to the billions of issues that can be found in project and revision management systems.
  Context-aware IDE and think tank in open source architecture, openned the path to approaches that support developers during their programming sessions by leveraging past knowledge and architectures.

  However, these techniques are still not broadly adopted by praticionners in large software companies.
  The main problem is the lack of actionable inteligence.
  Indeed, such systems tend to be seen as black boxes that yield false positive by end-users.
  Moreover, actions to resolve an identified problem can be hard to identify or to apply.

  In this research proposal, we present four approaches: (a) an online bug-fix search engine and API ({\tt BUMPER}, Bug MetarePository for dEveloper and Researcher), (b) an approach to automatically reproduce bug submitted to bug-report systems ({\tt JCHARMING}, Java CrasH Automatic Reproduction by directed Model checkING), (c) a recommendation system to propose the right auto-completion at the right time using actionnable inteligence ({\tt RESEMBLE}, REcommendation System based on cochangE Mining at Block LEvel) and, finally, (d) an approach to prevent bug insertion at commit-time by leveraging decade of open-source history ({\tt BIANCA}, Bug Insertion ANticipation by Clone Analysis at commit time).
  We also propose a taxonomy of bugs.
  When combined into {\tt pErICOPE} (Ecosystem Improve source COde during Programming session with real-time mining of common knowlEdge), these tools (i) provide the possibility to search related software artifacts using natural language, (ii) accurately reproduce field-crash in lab environment, (iii) recommend improvement or completion of block of code under edition and (iv) prevent the introduction of issues at commit time.

  This proposal develops on these ideas in more depth while highlighting remaining issues and the PhD schedule.
