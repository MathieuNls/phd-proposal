\begin{abstract}

  The maintenance and evolution processes of systems account for more than 70\% of the man-hours in companies.
  Hundreds of papers have been published with the aim to improve our knowledge of these processes in terms of issue triaging, issue prediction, duplicate issue detection, issue reproduction and co-changes prediction.
  All these publications gave meaning to the millions of issues that can be found in open source issue \& project and revision management systems.
  Context-aware IDE and think tank in open source architecture, open the path to approaches that support developers during their programming sessions by leveraging past indexed knowledge and past architectures.

  In this research proposal, we present four approaches : {\tt BUMPER}, {\tt JCHARMING}, {\tt RESEMBLE} and {\tt BIANCA}. We also propose a taxonomy of bugs. When combined into {\tt pErICOPE} (Ecosystem Improve source COde during Programming session with real-time mining of common knowlEdge), these tools (i) provide the possibility to search related software artifacts using natural language, (ii) accurately reproduce field-crash in lab environment, (iii) recommend improvement or completion of current block of code and (iv) prevent the introduction of clones / issues at commit time.

  This proposal proposal develops on these ideas in more depth while highlighting remaining issues. In this proposal, we discuss the PhD schedule.
