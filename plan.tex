\chapter{Research Plan\label{chap:plan}}

In this chapter, we present the current state of research. Section \ref{sec:current-state} presents our current contributions and section \ref{sec:publication-plan} presents our publication plan.

\section{Current State of Research\label{sec:current-state}}

Chapter \ref{chap:methodology} presented the current state of our research. The completed parts are :

\begin{itemize}
	\item To create a taxonomy of bug (section \ref{sec:taxo}).
	\item To make software artifacts such as source code, issues, tasks, comments and more searchable using natural language and not structured query language (section \ref{sec:BUMPER}).
	\item To efficiently reproduce field crashes in lab environment without raising any privacy concerns (section \ref{sec:JCHARMING}).
	\item To sequentially mine co-changes (section \ref{sec:RESEMBLE}).
	\item To normalize source code (sections \ref{sec:RESEMBLE} and \ref{sec:BIANCA}).
	\item To efficiently compare normalized source code (sections \ref{sec:RESEMBLE} and \ref{sec:BIANCA}).
	\item To raise warning when a normalized source code matches another normalized source code known to have introduce a defect in an application (section \ref{sec:BIANCA}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Current Contribution\label{sec:current-state}}

We already have one contribution referred in an international journal \cite{Nayrolles2016a}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Nayrolles, M. , Hamou-Lhadj, W., Tahar, S. & Larsson, A. (2016). A Bug Reproduction Approach Based on Directed Model Checking and Crash Traces. Journal of Software: Evolution and Process. Wiley. (Accepted with revisions).
\end{itemize}

and three contributions referred in international conferences \cite{Nayrolles2015,Maiga2014,Nayrolles2016b, Nayrolles2016c}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Nayrolles, M. \& Hamou-Lhadj, W. (2016). BUMPER: A Tool to Cope with Natural Language Search of Millions Bugs and Fixes. International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering - Tool Track (SANER'16). IEEE. (Accepted).
	\item Mathieu Nayrolles, Abdelwahab Hamou-Lhadj, Tahar Sofiene, and Alf Larsson. JCHARMING : A Bug Reproduction Approach Using Crash Traces and Directed Model Checking. In SANER'15, pages 101-110, 2015. (Best Paper Award).
	\item Maiga, A., Hamou-Lhadj, W., Nayrolles, M. , Sabor, K. \& Larsson, A. (2015). An Empirical Study on the Handling of Crash Reports in a Large Software Company: An Experience Report. International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME). (pp. 342-351). IEEE.
\end{itemize}

Finally, we also presented {\tt BUMPER} during the 2015 Consortium for Software Engineering Research Fall Edition \cite{Nayrolles2015e}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Nayrolles, M. \& Hamou-Lhadj, W. (2015). BUMPER: Bug Metarepository Search Engine for Developers and Researchers. Consortium for Software Engineering Research Fall.
\end{itemize}

\section{Plan for short term work\label{sec:planning}}

As short term work, we want to complete the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Recommend code in order to improve a sub-optimum code.
	\item Recommend code in order to complete an incomplete piece of code.
	\item Develop IDE plugins
	\item Develop new parsers (Github, Sourceforge) in order to improve:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The coverage of {\tt BUMPER}.
		\item The precision of {\tt RESEMBLE} and {\tt BIANCA}.
		\item The accuracy of our Bug Taxonomy.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Publication Plan\label{sec:publication-plan}}

This section presents our planned publications over the course of the next year.
Depending on time constraints and possible invitations to journal extension, publication can be removed or added during the next years.

\begin{itemize}

	\item {\bf Publication 6}. {\tt BIANCA} will be submitted to {\tt International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering, ISSRE 2016}.
	\item {\bf Publication 7}. {\tt PRECINCT} will be submitted to {\tt International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation, SCAM 2016}.
	\item {\bf Publication 8}. {\tt RESEMBLE} will be submitted to {\tt International Conference Software Maintenance and Evolution, ICSME 2017}.
	\item {\bf Publication 9}. Our proposed bug taxonomy will be submitted to {\tt Transaction of Software Engineering, TSE 2017}.
	\item {\bf Publication 10}. Our ecosystem as a whole, {\tt BUMPER}, {\tt JCHARMING}, {\tt RESEMBLE} and {\tt BIANCA} will be submitted to {\tt Transaction of Software Engineering, TSE 2017}.
	\item {\bf Thesis}. In parallel to publications 10 and 11, I plan to write my Ph.D thesis.
\end{itemize}
